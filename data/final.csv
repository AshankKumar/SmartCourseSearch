Is it art's job to create the cultural myths that bind society together, or to deconstruct them? Who participates in modern and contemporary art, and who doesn't? What kinds of production should be considered art? How are specific formal strategies informed by the perspectives of different subject positions? What politics underwrite them? We will consider, and reconsider, the existing narratives about art during this period with a dual aim: first, to better understand the historical positions of the artists in question, and, second, to piece together a prehistory of the moment in which we currently find ourselves.",3,['Humanities - Lit & Arts course'],65135,3.21,[6]

ENGL,209,Early British Literature and Culture,"This course surveys more than a thousand years of British literature from the early Middle Ages through the Renaissance and well into the eighteenth century. But what does ""British literature"" really mean, especially in the context of an island archipelago populated by multiple nations (England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) and repeatedly subjected to foreign rule (either by violent invasion or dynastic succession)? The range of texts we thus characterize as ""early British literature"" is staggering, and part of our goal in this course will simply be to appreciate the sheer volume and breadth of written work created in Britain and Ireland between the sixth and eighteenth centuries. We will do this through a necessarily selective sampling of historical periods, languages, and genres. Our authors will range from the famous (e.g., Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton) to the lesser-known (e.g., Marie de France, Lady Mary Wroth, and Eliza Haywood) to the unknown (e.g., the anonymous Beowulf-poet).

ERAM,557,Meaning Patterns: Semiotics and the Interpretation of Meanings in Education and the Social Sciences,"Addresses the ways in which knowledge is represented, with special reference to the knowledge representations of teachers and learners. Its interdisciplinary bases are functional linguistics, semiotics, philosophy, history of ideas, media/communication studies, and ontology in computer science. The focal point of the course is the five questions about meaning posed by Cope and Kalantzis in their transpositional grammar: ""what is this about?"" (reference); ""who or what is doing this?"" (agency); ""what holds this together?"" (structure); ""how does this fit with its surroundings?"" (context); and ""what is this for?"" (interest). Along these lines of inquiry, a transpositional grammar addresses language, image, embodied action, object and space. ""Transposition"" refers to the movement across these various forms of meaning, intensified in the era of pervasively multimodal, digitally-mediated communications. Applied to education, not only does this provide a valuable heuristic to reframe literacy teaching and learning (the original impulse for the development of this grammar). It also offers an integrated account of meaning-to-learn across all subject areas, including pedagogical content knowledge and learner knowledge representations. Conceived in the broader terms of social-scientific research methods, transpositional grammar is an attempt to overcome the narrowness and logocentrism of ""the language turn"" which dominated social sciences in the twentieth century. In a practical sense, semiotics of the kind explored in this course also provides tools for reading and interpreting multimodal texts and research data. 4 graduate hours.
